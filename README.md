Note: don't close your threads so that they are not "hidden" and other people with simmilar questions can more easily find your thread.

## Why no 'real' mailing list?
Because I think GitHub issues is superior to a mailing list. For example, the GitHub integration is obviously the best. You can just create an Issue for any question, suggestion or wish here.

## Subscribe
To subscribe to the mailing list, just watch this repo. If you want to subscribe to a specific thread, watch that particular issue.
